**Goal:** Building an optical tweezer setup with a tunable lens that allows for smooth transport of trapped molecules by changing the focal point via applied current.

**Motivation:** 
The Ni group is using ultracold atoms and molecules to explore the coldest chemical
reactions in the world (~500nK). One of the crucial steps in these experiments is the transport of
ultracold reagents from where they are made in a cooling chamber to the final chemistry
chamber, which is about 30cm away. Both chambers have an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) inside
and are connected by a tube.

The ultracold atoms and molecules are trapped in the focus of a laser beam, a mechanism
called an optical dipole trap (ODT) or optical tweezer. We can move the focus of the ODT to
transport reagents. In order to get accurate results, it is important that there is minimal heating
and number loss throughout this process. Thus, the transport system needs to be low-noise (no
jittering of its position), flexible (easily controlled moving trajectory), and compact (not
occupying too much space).

The current setup involves a translation stage system to physically move particles from
the MOT chamber to the Science chamber. However, this takes up significant space and has high
building costs. It also has poor efficiency due to the vibration of the translation stage and
changes in the focal powers of the lenses caused by the heat generated by the laser beams. My
work this summer entails the design and assembling of a temperature-correcting atomic dipole
trap transport system. The optical set-up involves a focus tunable lens, whose focal power can be
controlled based on the current that is sent into it. Monitoring both the current and temperature
on the surface of the tunable lens and implementing it into an active temperature correction
routine allows for stabilized control of the atom number and reduced wave-front error and beam
aberrations. This set-up is also more robust, since it occupies less space and depends solely on
the current being supplied to the tunable lens.

**tldr:**
- built tunable lens system
- programmed a temperature correction routine for refocusing laser beam
