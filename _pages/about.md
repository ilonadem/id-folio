I am a senior at Harvard concentrating in physics with a secondary in computer science.  I'm interested in physics-informed approaches to training neural networks and computer vision problems.

Over the past few years I've dabbled in pose detection, automatic differentiation, encryption for secure ML, astronomy visualization, and cryptocurrencies.

In my past life I was training to become a professional ballerina at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. I'm excited by the intersection of the arts with the sciences, and the "dance" of physics through topics of machine learning, computer vision, biology, and astronomy.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
