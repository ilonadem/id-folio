I am a second-year PhD student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at Caltech, co-advised by [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io) and [Pietro Perona](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/perona). Previously, I graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in physics, where I was fortunate to work with [Michael Brenner](https://brennergroup.seas.harvard.edu/?_gl=1*1g3aqx*_ga*MTIyMDQ2ODA0Ny4xNjgxMzQ1MDYw*_ga_Q97GE6JKJ9*MTY4MTc4MjcwNC4xLjAuMTY4MTc4MjcwNC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_FNNHYP076Y*MTY4MTc4MjcwNC4xLjAuMTY4MTc4MjcwNC4wLjAuMA..). 

I'm interested in computer vision problems involving dynamic 3D scene representations and camera pose estimation. 

My graduate research is funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/contact/about-grfp/) and the [Caltech EAS Chair Scholarship](https://easchairscholars.caltech.edu/#:~:text=The%20EAS%20Chair%20Scholars%20Program,the%20EAS%20Division%20and%20Caltech.).
