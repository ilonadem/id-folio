I am an incoming PhD candidate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at Caltech, co-advised by [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io) and [Pietro Perona](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/perona). This May, I will graduate from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in physics, where I have been fortunate to work with [Michael Brenner](https://brennergroup.seas.harvard.edu/?_gl=1*1g3aqx*_ga*MTIyMDQ2ODA0Ny4xNjgxMzQ1MDYw*_ga_Q97GE6JKJ9*MTY4MTc4MjcwNC4xLjAuMTY4MTc4MjcwNC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_FNNHYP076Y*MTY4MTc4MjcwNC4xLjAuMTY4MTc4MjcwNC4wLjAuMA..). 

I'm interested in computer vision problems involving 3D scene representations and pose detection, self-supervised learning, and applications to neurological assessments and clinical diagnostics.
<!-- I'm excited by scene representations, neurological assessment algorithms, and pose estimation, and the ability of such models to have a direct, positive impact on human lives.  -->

My graduate research will be funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship]() and the [Caltech EAS Chair Scholarship]().

<!-- In my past life I was training to become a professional ballerina at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. Nowadays I'm often running, playing tennis, dancing, reading, journaling, and trying to find the perfect cup of coffee. I'm excited by the intersection of the arts with the sciences, and the "dance" of physics and math through topics of machine learning, computer vision, biology, and astronomy. -->

<!-- I am a senior at Harvard concentrating in physics with a secondary in computer science.  I'm interested in physics-informed approaches to training neural networks and computer vision problems, and using computational tools like machine learning for problems in science.

In graduate school, I intend to work on problems in this domain, building new computational tools and machine learning methods for physical systems. By teaching computers to discern the world as well as humans can, we can use these models to make progress on unsolved problems that have a tangible impact on human lives. My interest in modeling the world comes from my undergraduate training in physics: from understanding learned representations and latent spaces to the design of optimizers and group equivariant transformations to leveraging automatic differentiation for new paradigms of model training, it equipped me with an eagerness and a toolkit for delving inside models that are so often written off as black boxes. My interest in machine learning research came out of my work experiences in industry, which confirmed to me that machine learning already has a significant impact in a diverse set of fields. But above all, I am driven by the ability of these models to have a direct, positive impact on human lives.
